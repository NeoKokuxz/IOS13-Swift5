## Dark-mode and Vector 
- System color will change automatically, custom color will need to be added to asset in order to modify. 
  - Under asset -> add new color set (default -Light -Dark)
- Vector image will always stay shape when zoom in.

## Swift protocols & Delegate design parttern
- Delegate are protocols
```Swift 
protocol UITextFieldDelegate
```
- A text field calls the methods of its delegate in response to important changes. You use these methods to validate text that was typed by the user, to respond to specific interactions with the keyboard, and to control the overall editing process. Editing begins shortly before the text field becomes the first responder and displays the keyboard (or its assigned input view).
